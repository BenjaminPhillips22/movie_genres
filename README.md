### Multi-label text classifiction with starspace in R. 

Check out the [blog post](nothing.here.atm), discussing this project.

We will predict movie genres based on the text describing the plot. The [data](http://www.cs.cmu.edu/~ark/personas/) is from wikipedia pages for each movie. The R package we use is the [ruimtehol package](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/ruimtehol/index.html) which was created using methods developed by the [facebook research team](https://research.fb.com/downloads/starspace/).
